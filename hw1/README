Gaussian mixture model project with EM algorithm

There are two programs included in this folder:
- EMAlgorithm (main is in Classification.cc) - build using "make Classification"
- testModel (main is in likelihoodGivenModel.cc) - build using "make Testing"


#### EMAlgorithm
EMAlgorithm takes a set of data and number of clusters and generates new parameters for the clusters based
on the EMAlgorithm. Run in the following way:

EMAlgorithm <#clusters> <trainingdatafile> <clusteroutputfile>
e.g.
EMAlgorithm 3 wine.train clusters.txt

EMAlgorithm generates 3 files:
  -- specified by user: the clusters trained on the training data. This is in the format specified in the
     homework.
  -- clusteredData.csv: the inferred clusters for each data point (the cluster with the greatest probability).
  -- logLikelihoods.csv: the log-likelihoods computed for each iteration of the EM-algorithm. 

#### testModel
testModel tests a previously generated model on a different dataset to give you the log likelihood of that 
data set being generated by the model. Run in the following way:

testModel <testdatafile> <modeldatafile>
e.g.
testModel wine.test clusters.txt

#### In this folder
This folder also includes the Model class, which stores information about various clusters and data. Both
testModel and EMAlgorithm use these classes. 

My homework solutions are included in the PDF hw_1.pdf. If you have any problems opening this or viewing the equations please let me know and I can try to reformat the file.
